Recipe Sharing Platform

This is a dynamic recipe sharing platform that allows users to browse, search, and save their favorite recipes. The application utilizes Firebase for authentication and data storage, and ThemealDB API to fetch recipes. We also incorporate Framer Motion for animations and React Toastify for real-time notifications. The platform includes a secure favorites page where only authenticated users can save and access their favorite recipes. We also integrated form validation using schema validation for a smooth user experience.
